### Nekos.Net 
An official `.NET Core` wrapper for [nekos.life](https://nekos.life) targetting .NET Core 2.1 (2.2 soon)

Other version of this library (i will NOT give you ANY support) : https://bitbucket.org/_NaTiVe/nekosdotnet/src/master/

### Using this
1. Clone this repo
2. Open Visual Studio and click Build
3. Copy Nekos.Net.dll and Newtonsoft.Json.dll in bin/netcoreapp21/Debug into your project
4. Add reference of Nekos.Net in your project

### Documentation
When you use IntelliSense, Visual Studio will show the documentation of that function (with XMLDoc)

### TODO 
- [ ] Upload this to NuGet
- [ ] Proper documentation
  - [ ] Integrate docfx into my lib
- [ ] Upload the documentation
  - [ ] Finding how to host docfx in GitHub Pages (I will be blessed if someone helps me)
- [ ] Rewrite the endpoint system to [enum type](https://www.tutorialsteacher.com/csharp/csharp-enum)
